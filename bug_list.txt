Bug:
Fixed: 
- Can talk properly 1-1 relationship server-client
- Start 2 clients at the same time (no read/write yet) -> server won't receive the second client
- After shut down one client and connect another client -> server won't receive that new client
- After one client shutdowns, the server output some random stuff
